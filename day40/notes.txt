http : protocol for data exchange between browsers and servers
hypertext transfer protocol

api
application programming interface

REST 
Representational State transfer
design style for creating web services using http methods

restful design principles:
  - client-server architecture: ui is separate from the backend, allowing independent evolution
  - statelessness: every request contains all info needed, server doesnt store session data
  - cacheable: clients can store responses to reduce repeated requests and improve performance
  - uniform interface: rest apis use consistent http methods, simplifying interactions with resources

Spring Data Access
- simplifies db interaction by automating tasks like managing connections and writing queries

DataSource
manages db connections in Spring automatically

DAO
Data Access Object
design pattern separating db logic from business logic for cleaner code

ORM
Object Relational mapping
Maps java objects to db tables automatically

Repository
Provides methods for db operations without needing sql

sql
Structured Query Language
standard language to interact with dbs
SELECT
INSERT
UPDATE
DELETE

***********
how Spring Data Access helps
automates db interaction, simplifying tasks liek connection management and query generation


JDBC
Java DB Connectivity
- jdbc is the core way java apps communicate with dbs, requiring detailed steps for each interaction
1. open connection: link java to db
2. send query: execute sql instructions
3. process result: handle the returned data or confirmation
- while it gives full control, you must do everything manually


Spring Data JPA
Java Persistence API
- simplifies db operations by using Java objects instead of writing sql. it converts java objects to db rows automatically
- based off of ORMs
- @Entity defines class as a db table
- @Id identifies property id as primary key
- other fields become table columns
- entityManager.persist(): jpa automatically generates sql insert query and saves the object to the db

*******
Hibernate
- enhances jpa with powerful features for efficient db operations
why use?
  - caching: reduces queries by storing frequently used data
  - lazy loading : loads data only when needed
  - auto table creation: automatically generates tables from java classes

******
H2 Database
- lightweight, open source relational db for testing or small apps. it operates in :
  - embedded mode: runs inside your apps
  - server mode: acts as a standalone server

- in memory: data only lasts during runtime
- embedded: self contained for small apps
- sql support: standard sql queries
- web console: web based management

- commonly used in devlopment and testing
- well suited for small apps
